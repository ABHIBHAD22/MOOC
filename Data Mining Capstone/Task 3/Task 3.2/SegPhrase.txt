recommend this restaurant to anyone
away from the strip
items such as
before closing time
completely different

most likely
more expensive than

only drawback

simple yet
these days
on the other end
bordering on
return here again
cares about
during our stay
restaurants in this area

one of the waitresses
we started with
assured me
at the front counter
tender and juicy
let him know
wait for a table
close to my home
were seated within minutes
things to eat
in the right direction
my favorite thing on the menu
two days later
i must say
chicken with vegetables
trays of food
totally empty
prices are average
a dim sum restaurant
service is average
be careful
very pleased with
a family favorite
this was not the case
we got the check

on the east side of town
mix between
helped me
i like the fact that
not busy at all
don't know what happened
my boyfriend ordered
worth your time
on the smaller side
along the lines of
menu is huge
didn't care for
the inside of the restaurant
the majority of the
two item combo
on the spicy side
one of my all time favorite
hard to eat
if you are staying at the
at the last minute
dirty look
tell ya
unlike most
don't even get me started
my son

the owners are very nice
egg rolls were not
overwhelmed by
can't remember what
we were the only non
at the next table
like the plague
waiting outside
the place is small and
pieces of chicken
has changed
you get a ton of food
wait an hour
take out orders
i'll stick with
above the rest
as good as the ones
at the end of the day
nobody else
placed our orders
upside down
the name of the restaurant
off of the strip
this is our go to place

your tongue
curious about

warm and friendly
as simple as
party of three
plates of food

this place for years
i've been to

reviews on this place
tons of food

the service was attentive and
the taste of the food is
a lot worse

nothing too special
back to this place again
wave down
his hands
dressed up
you know what i mean
makes me want to
held up
had trouble finding
he loves
this place works
is one of our favorite
my partner
a little more expensive than
decided to eat
check on us
i am a big fan of
last time i went
next time i am in vegas
i have to say that the
on christmas day
the staff is always friendly and
equally as good
after reading all
don't be scared
he likes
too bad either
there is something for everyone
tofu and mushroom
quick and friendly
wanted to pay
i didn't know what to expect
on a saturday night
throwing up
if u want
sauce that came with it was
the guy on the phone
which consisted of
been there several times
a year and a half
cleaner than
hole in the wall spot
take a look at the
if i'm in the area
not a fan of
don't expect much
appetizers and entrees
at lunch time
you are looking for
every week
don't be fooled by
if you don't have a
give it another try
wondering how
re fried
craving for chinese
bad at all
as i would have liked
stars instead of
the place is a little
what do you expect
sums up
when i'm in the mood for
give them a second chance
will not be returning to this
we were seated right away
this is my go to place
cant remember
the first time i came here
a couple of dishes
i thought this place was
nice and attentive
pretty good as well
after hearing
definitely worth checking out
the employees are very
tasty as well
sitting on top of
they're open late
i've been here times
this is my second time
as quickly as
this place can get
nothing to brag about
off the plane
take outs
comes with an egg roll
two stars for
the service is always friendly
the amount of food they give
make me feel
knock off
next time we're in
decor and ambiance
the food is alright
the whole time we were
service has always been great
choice of rice
a little on the bland side
on vacation
no joke
makes me feel like
amazing as well
she apologized
during our meal
in comparison to the
right off the bat
we ordered take out
i've been here many times
stands out
been here about times
price was reasonable
took over an hour
be warned
nothing memorable
considering how much
would definitely come here again
unless you're
can handle
juicy and flavorful
the noodles were a little
my go to place for chinese
don't feel like driving
decent as well
drive to chinatown
you pick your
been here numerous times
don't even know what
dont know how
has improved
little saigon
i've been here several times
doesn't sound
who would have thought
every time i visit
one of our favorite places
food is consistently
specializes in
lots and lots of
the place is always clean
can't wait to go back again
meats and vegetables
the beef is tender
after minutes of waiting
my favorite appetizer
loved it so much
standouts for me
five years
a little on the salty side
clean and comfortable
bland and tasteless
who lives in
last time i was there
they charge you for
i'm not much of a
place for take out
cannot comment
suggested we try
i've never had anything
these folks
this place sucks
the staff was very friendly and
closes at
not nearly as good as
to pick up my order
i was very impressed with the
it's open hours
a little bit
just the way i like it
meats and veggies
go wrong with
during our visit
the staff is always very
will be back for sure
being open hours
i will be back to try
she said she
my only complaint is that
you would get at a
after finishing
type of place
that's to be expected
i am a fan of
light and crispy
last friday
the restaurant is beautiful
were spot on
which is always a good sign
crunchy on the outside
need i say more
the food was good and the
beef was tough
last time we went
trying new places
order it again
while waiting for my
the fact that we had
about minutes after
even remotely
the food is better than
i felt like i was in
this place is really good
the best thing on the menu
service was efficient
in the middle of
a bad meal
this place gets
an adult
on par with other
i've been eating at
a bit dry
food to come out
wait for your food
near my office
vouch for
vegetables are always
not hot enough
neither hot nor
my husband and i both
why anyone would
have yet to find
my roommates
i've tried so far
it was my first time
food is always fresh
the chicken was moist and
this place last night
the food was better than
one thing that
would have been better
make sense
i've definitely had better
don't plan on
for lunch the next day
right around the corner from
didn't have to wait long
the soup came out
concerned about
this was my first time
i have to say this is
our favorite dishes
place to grab
i've ever seen
a group of us
waiting for us
the food is not good
we gave it a try
three words
get a lot of food for
was not impressed with the
peas and carrots
rice and company
because we were starving
you'll notice
would come back again
order was wrong
too much msg
when you want something
was very good as well
family of four
towards the end
i've been here a few times
next time i'm in
we ordered a side of
people watching
old lady
ordering from here
a ton of money
family and friends
place that serves
next time i'll try
fresh and plentiful
rounding up
ask your server
a lot of food for a
the first time i went here
make sure to ask
duck and pork
there are a couple of
can't wait to
one of the things i
my chinese friends
this is my first review
total came out to
right in front of
decided to try it out
couldn't understand
kept coming
excellent as well
i thought it was pretty good
made from scratch
commenting on
not knowing what
couldn't figure out
came out very fast
like this place a lot
the waitress was very nice
the food was very good and
this place several times
could be improved
the only downside is that
if you plan on
give me a break
read a review
to eat healthy
an alternative
so i can't comment on
flavors and textures
delicious as well
veggies and meat
turns out to be
around dinner time
their lunch specials are
easy to get
a decent chinese restaurant
place is dirty
think twice before
make an exception
the sauce that comes with
much tastier
it would have been nice
we ordered entrees
take aways
trying to figure out what
whole in the wall
maybe that's why
you'd expect from a
wouldn't order again
save your money and go
to sit down and eat
who wants
an awesome place
a few doors down
almost immediately
will definitely eat here again
service is so so
over salted
this has got to be
i am not sure what
paid and left
the first thing i noticed was
put our name
oh boy
the restaurant itself is very
better than some of the
have to wait for a table
the place was very clean and
fantastic as well
to kick it up
everytime we go
about minutes before
going downhill
heated up
two separate
the last time i ordered
will be back soon
here at least once a week
hotter than
when you first walk in
call in an order
as fast as
give it another chance
this place will do
the best i have had in
i've had much better
i would definitely eat here again
we finished our meal
the service is fast and the
my wife and i decided to
i have been here twice
rich and flavorful
the interior is very
the look and feel of
the front of the line
towards the end of the
this is a must try
usually do take out
i've never had such
places i've been to
dishes came out
let me down
i'm giving it stars
per week
tasted more like
will definately
your choice of
a bit dark
found this place by accident
quite a bit of food
other types of
wanted to go
throw in some
which ended up being
couldn't even eat it
noodles with beef
front of house
has been consistent
helpful and friendly
i'll be honest
went here last night
with a grain of salt
i'd suggest
never heard of
second time around
in front of us
the last time i had
i've eaten there
taught me
he brought us
nothing to rave about
the portion was huge
this particular location
off putting
one star because
attentive and friendly
those of us who
what appeared to be
little macau
leftovers the next day
our bellies
they do not deliver
i'm not even sure
shrimp and veggies
will never go back to this
i've ever tasted
when i was a kid
the food is the same
i can tell you that
my boyfriend and i ordered
her hands
try something new
let me say
both sides of the
get takeout from
second rate
first time trying
the place is very clean and
a nice amount of
went there last night
sitting in front of
a refill on my
the fact that it was
the food is tasty and
can't afford
tofu and vegetables
i would have given them
i've been looking for a
order them again
as busy as
modern and clean
we decided to try it out
you can buy at
a bit of a
last time i ate
pieces of shrimp
this restaurant is located in
after church
if you haven't been here
hard to describe
easy to get to
i have to say it was
every time we visit
noodles with chicken
know what to expect
an employee
there is a wide variety of
tasted like old
never ending
crisp and fresh
the quality of the fish
everyone loves
my beloved
a larger group
next time i visit
a couple of other
a huge deal
two orders of
ordered from this place
visit to vegas
so we decided to try it
i am not a fan of
quality and freshness
service was very good
really stand out
not sure what happened
this place reminds me of
a lot better than
we decided to get
should have known
let me just say
during my stay
take our orders
while waiting for
could have used more
in the middle of the night
oh yea
five bucks
if you're looking for a good
i'm guessing
we needed something
keep that in mind
those who want
great as well
the guy at the counter
this place for lunch
can be a bit
dishes to share
no choice but to
the wontons were good
hung up on
the food was delicious and the
this place is awesome
an order of
cut back on
service is awesome
gotten sick
i do have to say
relatively quickly
nothing really stood out
quite frequently
fresh and hot
was kind enough to
i've had better
expect it to be
my aunt
not expecting much
as big as
does the job
you get a choice of
doesn't taste like
in this part of town
without question
soft and fluffy
came with a group of
polite and attentive
makes me think
the decor is a bit
mess that up
there were only two other
trying something new
will continue to go
this place is legit
the rest of the night
i've ever eaten
year round
out of town
took our drink orders
what makes this place
a soft spot
pieces of pork
located right next to
be going back
will come back for
dropping off
every few minutes
not sure if
could have been a little more
much to be desired
remembers us
warm and welcoming
way too much
our first visit
tough and chewy
dry and hard
your food to go
for the rest of the day
off the charts
server did not
third visit
i decided to take
so you don't have to
i've never been to a
as flavorful as
this place needs a
for years to come
i wouldn't come back
do not eat here
this is my new favorite
very friendly and accommodating
haven't been here in
bright and clean
given menus
meat and vegetables
hell yeah
keep driving
type of restaurant
exactly what i wanted
where i live
more than made up for
a bit more expensive than
when they first opened
he asked if
the only reason i gave
i took one bite and
place in arizona
oh god
may sound
came here for dinner
two other tables
want to like this place
your lips
every time we come

takeout from here
down to earth
thoroughly enjoyed our

an absolute
almost inedible
we ended up here
especially love their
i'd definitely go back
a handful of
the highlight of my
light and flavorful
well worth it
the food here is really
food is always excellent
i have been to this place
dare i say
the food was cold and
as bad as
my favorite restaurant in vegas
in terms of taste
here's a tip
rushing us
i thought i'd give it a
to decide what to
just thinking about
nothing special about it
a big eater
will be returning
give it stars because
while we waited for our
can't go wrong with anything
the shape of a
this place makes
don't bother with
you won't be sorry
will probably be back
ordered a couple of
price is decent
ready in about
a hole in
and you don't want to
i'll definitely come back
tasty and filling
this is one of the few
one of those places
i knew i had to
his response
we opted for the
pieces of beef
would expect from
whenever i'm in vegas
large enough for
if you live in the area
very happy with
this is one of my favorite
my wife and i went
no fuss
let me know
pricey for what it is
the edge of the
i'm used to
topped off with
a bunch of times
when you walk into
nothing special at all
the service is a little slow
happy with this place
i can't get enough of
better than i expected
don't want to cook
eggplant and tofu
be back to try more
know how to cook
dish to arrive
to grab a quick bite
when we got home
the place looks like
acknowledge us
my friend asked for
well maintained
soft and chewy
star from me
been trying to find
i used to live in
group of people
you cannot go wrong
to try this place out
buffet at asia
thin slices of
i'm going to
there were a lot of people
i've lived in
will go back again
my boyfriend and his
for those of you that
eager to try
should be called
well balanced
makes up for
thought it was a little
with ginger and scallions
they changed their
grew up in
ten bucks
somewhat lacking
we started off with
as much as i did
it's located in
flavorful and tender
for what you get
if you go during
your run of the mill
a bit spicy
this place offers
sit well with
got to be kidding
after looking at the menu
under a heat lamp
on my next trip to vegas
one of a kind
a bowl of egg drop soup
fine with me
our favorites are
thin strips of
way too high
i'd give it stars
right in front of us
i would go back
friendly and fast
my boyfriend's
forgive me
keep going back
been a long time since
there was only one other
more flavor than
a bit tough
take out and delivery
gave it a try
wait to get in
this place could be
want to make sure
enough for two meals
an asian place
looked and tasted
after a long night of drinking
i've been there times
we ordered a few
the food is just so
the girl behind the counter
the food was bland and
they are always busy
came with egg drop soup
water to drink
nothing out of the ordinary
you will not regret
this is one of those
finally made it
off the hook
tell you the truth
several times now
he said he
order a side of
should have been
fall in love with
better than panda express
i have been coming to
overcooked and dry
my whole life
our total bill
meals i've had
what they are doing
only negative is
when i lived in
coming here again
my personal favorites are
give them a try
on a friday night
to wait a few minutes
wash it down
after living in
a must try
the lady at the counter
a few more times
if you are staying
an option for
she said yes
the remainder of the
a bit overpriced
had a hankering for
give it another shot
have ordered from here
never seen before
at least times a week
food was delivered
doesn't disappoint
the only reason why i
was excited to try this place
despite the fact that
a few weeks later
garnished with
back home in
take out container
a hair in my
meat and veggies
to make a reservation
have to ask for it
a take out order
as greasy as
very friendly people
to talk to us
a bit heavy
i would recommend trying
return to this place
water and tea
i would be willing to
in the same plaza as
we decided to share
it was our first time there
didn't taste like
fresh and crunchy
ambiance was nice
never eat here again
delivery was fast
well decorated
within mins
dish came out
long at all
wasn't anything special
my husband and i came
food was okay but
when we walked in
have no idea what
shrimp and scallop
would order again
the lady behind the counter
if you look at
i want to go back
nothing really special
we started out with
not care about
other places in town
been coming here since they
i'll be going back
you're better off
overpowered by
food is made to order
a week later
in other cities
would not recommend
hardly any
nice as well
my favorite place to get
made me sick
if you're a fan of
other than that
the fact that they have
through the doors
come back here
is one of my favorite restaurants
i haven't been there
who took my order
at am in the morning
several times since
to begin with
get take out from here
the chicken was tender and
we've eaten here
don't care for
between two people
waiter was very attentive
they got rid of
my girlfriend ordered
lucky for me
a bit slow
would have been more
i have to say that i
i have to say i was
i'd definitely come back
you order your food
my friends who
been pleased with
spot to eat
we ended up at
call in your order
they also have
staff are always
shrimp and vegetables
an off night
since my last visit
stars because they
have not been disappointed
or something like that
over powered
in a strip mall
two or three
the service was very slow
how we were doing
we get take out
i'm not sure if they
messed up our
price was fair
nothing beats
when i'm in town
hard to believe
there was a good amount of
make it a point to
my friend and i were
what happens when
empty trays
i'll be back for sure
put my finger on
decided to check out
over a year ago
only regret is
service was so so
your tastebuds
four stars because
too far from the strip
we got take out
really enjoy this place
we finally got
if you need something
do not hesitate
service is poor
service is always good
a bit of an
do in a pinch
my experience at this
a long time
come back again
don't feel like cooking
gave it another
should have gone
too much salt
works for me
near my house
if you're in the mood for
hole in a wall
a place like this
by all means
would definitely recommend
one of the few places
crowd of people
nice and light
times a year
doesn't cut it
what can you expect
down the drain
they close at
i've had in a while
then proceeded to
if i'm in the mood for
under the weather
any type of
the food is just okay
there are a lot of
read about this
i have been going to
heard of this place
make your own
make you feel
the rest of the staff
taste and texture
once in awhile
the guy behind the counter
run out of
couldn't have been more
came here for lunch
i have to admit that
not too long ago
each time i go
be able to make
we ended up going
growing up in
texture and flavor
they brought out our
shrimp and scallops
i'll stick to
i've never had a bad experience
never go here again
short and sweet
after being seated
our second visit
our way through
this place for dinner
food is quite good
always a good sign
usually end up
will not go back
i will definitely be coming back
for a lot less
could have gone to
after a long night
you'll find
many other options
more often than not
to eat at this place
tried several dishes
if you're looking for something
this is our go to
we were very pleased with
this place to be
who grew up in
order came out
brought me here
when i saw

i've never seen a
had lunch here with
started with some
more than willing to
don't have to worry about
what i am used to
on our next visit
what's not to love
flavor and texture
impressed with how
prices are really good
this place would have
enjoy a meal
i've had in a long time

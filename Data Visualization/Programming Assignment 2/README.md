# Programming Assignment 2: Visualize Network Data

## Overview
This assignment is meant to give you the opportunity to do non-coordinate data visualization, specifically using a network of your choosing. 

## Goals
Network data lends itself easily to Graph Visualization. This assignment will allow you to explore the means of network visualization that you have encountered in the course, to decide how best to visualize data, and to analyze other network visualizations.

This assignment will also help you to analyze other visualizations and assess their effectiveness.

## Time Estimation
The time this assignment takes will vary greatly and depends a lot on your choice of data set, on the tools you use and on the customization of your data. Try to leave yourself at least three hours to devote to this assignment.

## Instructions
1. Find some Network Data that you think is suitable and that you would like to visualize. Here are some sites that provide links to a wide variety of different graph/network datasets:
  1. http://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html
  2. https://networkdata.ics.uci.edu/index.php
2. Choose a visualization platform and parse the data into a format suitable for the tools you will use.
  1. For non-programmers, there are downloadable programs for creating graph visualizations at: http://graphviz.org. The program "neato" is a good place to start, which creates a layout for an undirected graph based on multidimensional scaling. The main challenge with using these tools is converting the graph data into the input text file format used by the tool, and understanding (and experimenting with) the various tool settings.
  2. For programmers, there are graph visualization tools available in D3 for JavaScript, such as force directed graphs, treemaps, collision detection, and a nice graph drawing tutorial. Feel free to use any other libraries or languages as well.
3. Visualize the data in a meaningful way, keeping in mind the requirements of the rubric.

If you need them, there are free-to-use websites that you can use to write and execute D3 code:
* http://code.runnable.com (see also http://code.runnable.com/d3.js for examples)
* https://vida.io

## Submission
You must upload an image of your visualization for peer evaluation.
Alongside your visualizations, feel free to include a paragraph that helps explain your submission.
A few questions that your paragraph could answer:

1. What is the data that you chose? Why?
2. Did you use a subset of the data? If so, what was it?
3. Are there any particular aspects of your visualization to which you would like to bring attention?
4. What do you think the data, and your visualization, shows?

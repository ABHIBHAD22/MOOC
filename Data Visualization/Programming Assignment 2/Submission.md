# Data Visualization: Programming Assignment 2 Submission

## Overview
This file implements [Programming Assignment 2: Visualize Network Data](https://github.com/pauldeng/MOOC/tree/master/Data%20Visualization/Programming%20Assignment%202) for the Coursera [Data Visualization](https://class.coursera.org/datavisualization-001) Class, Aug 2015.

## The Data
[High school contact and friendship networks](http://www.sociopatterns.org/datasets/high-school-contact-and-friendship-networks/)

The data is directed, unweighted friendship network from surveys, space separated. It corresponds to the directed network of reported friendships. Each line has the form “i j”, meaning that student i reported a friendship with student j.

   * Answer: full dataset is used.
3. Are there any particular aspects of your visualization to which you would like to bring attention?
